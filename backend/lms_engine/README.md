# CAL LMS Engine - Developer Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up the **CAL LMS Engine** using **Poetry** for dependency management and **Docker** for containerization.

---

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Poetry** (for package and dependency management)
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **Git**

---

## 1. Install Poetry
If Poetry is not installed, use the following command:
```sh
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Verify installation:
```sh
poetry --version
```

---

## 2. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd backend/lms_engine
```

---

## 3. Setup with Poetry (Local Development)

### Install Dependencies
```sh
poetry install
```

### Activate Virtual Environment
```sh
poetry shell
```

### Apply Migrations
```sh
python manage.py migrate
```

### Create a Superuser
```sh
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Follow the prompts to set up an admin user.

### Run Development Server
```sh
python manage.py runserver
```
The LMS Engine and the REST API should now be available at **http://127.0.0.1:8000/**.

---

## 4. Setup with Docker (Production/Containerized Environment)
This method is primarily suited for **deployment** but can also be used for local development.

### Install Docker (if not installed)
Refer to the official Docker installation guide: [Docker Install](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Build and Start the Container
```sh
docker build -t cal-lms-engine .
docker-compose up -d
```

### Apply Migrations (Inside Container)
```sh
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

### Create Superuser (Inside Container)
```sh
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Check Logs
```sh
docker-compose logs -f
```

---

## 5. Environment Variables
Ensure you have a `.env` file in the root directory with the required environment variables. Example:
```ini
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@db:5432/lms_db
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

For **Docker**, environment variables can be managed inside `docker-compose.yml`.

---

## 6. Running Tests
To run tests locally:
```sh
pytest
```
To run tests inside Docker:
```sh
docker-compose exec web pytest
```

---

## 7. API Documentation
Once the server is running, access the API documentation at:
- **Scalar UI:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/docs`

---

## 8. Stopping and Cleaning Up
To stop the container:
```sh
docker-compose down
```
To remove unused containers, networks, and volumes:
```sh
docker system prune -a
```

---

## 9. Additional Notes
- Ensure database migrations are applied before running the server.
- Update `.env` with correct database credentials.
- Use `docker-compose.override.yml` for local configurations.

For any issues, check logs and confirm dependencies are correctly installed.
